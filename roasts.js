    "Does that look like a star to you? Did you skip pre-school?",
    "Bro, what the fuck is this? A collapsed lung? A demon’s asshole? This ain’t a star, dumbass.",
    "This is why aliens won’t contact us. You single-handedly lowered humanity’s collective IQ.",
    "Do you look up at the night sky and think, ‘Hah! That’s my grandma, a crumpled piece of… whatever the fuck this shape is’?",
    "Oh nice, you drew a… what the fuck even is this? A squashed spider? Satan’s asshole?",
    "Oh wow, you’ve invented a brand-new shape. Too bad it fucking SUCKS.",
    "If a kindergartener handed me this, I’d tell them to give up on life and take up plumbing instead.",
    "If you made any more mistakes, you would have discovered a new shape.",
    "I hope you’re never stranded at sea, because if you have to navigate by the stars, you’re fucking dead.",
    "Did you try to draw a star, or did your hand have a goddamn seizure on the canvas?",
    "If this was the only thing left to represent humanity, we deserve to go extinct."

    "I've seen drunk, one-eyed pigeons shit out more symmetrical shapes than this.",
    "You’ve somehow managed to fuck up a shape that literal cavemen drew correctly. Congrats, you're officially dumber than prehistoric rock paintings, you useless sack of disappointment.",
    "NASA just took you off the list of ‘intelligent life’ and downgraded you to ‘sentient fuckup.’ If the aliens see this, they’re gonna glass Earth out of sheer secondhand embarrassment.",
    "I’d tell you to go back to kindergarten, but even those kids have the basic motor skills you clearly fucking lack. Holy shit, dude, did you draw this by smashing your head against the screen?",
    "I've seen roadkill with better geometric comprehension. Go shove a fucking protractor up your ass and try again.",
    "You must be the reason why erasers exist. Holy fuck, my eyes hurt looking at this.",
    "I’d tell you to try again, but honestly, just quit. Stars don’t deserve this treatment.",
    "A five-year-old on meth could draw a better star. Seek professional help.",
    "You failed so hard that NASA just called and canceled all future space missions. No more stars for anyone. Good job, asshole.",
    "A drunk chicken could scratch out a better star in the dirt.",
    "If I had to rate this, I’d give it a -π/10. That’s right, negative irrational levels of garbage.",
    "Did you draw this with your feet? While blindfolded? In the middle of a fucking hurricane?",
    "This is what happens when you fail basic shapes in kindergarten.",
    "I’d recommend a ruler, but I don’t think even divine intervention could save your lines.",
    "This is the artistic equivalent of shitting yourself in public.",
    "I'd recommend a ruler, but we need a dictator to wipe this shit from existence",
    "I hope you never have to draw a pentagram for a demon summoning, because that motherfucker is gonna crawl out malformed as hell.",
    "This is why calculators exist—so dumbasses like you don’t have to deal with angles.",
    "A perfect star has five points. This has five hundred problems.",
    "At this point, you’d do better closing your eyes and headbutting the screen.",
    "Even a drunk toddler with Parkinson’s would be ashamed of this atrocity.",
    "Did your fucking fingers break mid-draw or do you just naturally suck at existing?",
    "Oh, you tried? That’s cute. Now try again without the dick in your mouth.",
    "You know what? I’ll give you points. Not for the star, but for being the first human to actively disappoint the entire fucking universe.",
    "Your star has been diagnosed with stage 4 ugliness and terminal dogshit syndrome.",
    "You just created the first star in history to file for disability benefits.",
    "This shit is so misshapen that even a fucking lobotomized pigeon would have done better with its goddamn feet.",
    "Your star is the artistic equivalent of tripping on your own dick and falling face-first into a wood chipper.",
    "This star looks like it was drawn by a rabid, one-eyed chihuahua mid-seizure.",
    "Your star has scoliosis, PTSD, and a fucking unpaid mortgage. It needs therapy, not criticism.",
    "I hope no one saw you draw this, they'd either bleach their eyes or chop your hands, or both?"

    "Hey! Not bad! Fuck you! Not good enough! Get back to it, moron.",
    "I see the resemblance to a star, but did it squeeze through a toilet before landing on the canvas?",
    "Could have been worse… knowing your geometry skills. Fuck you anyway! Not good enough! Try again, bitch!",
    "Oh wow, you actually got close. Congrats, you’re now as competent as a drunk toddler with a crayon.",
    "This is the star equivalent of a participation trophy. Are you proud of this? You shouldn’t be.",
    "Better than before! Which means it still sucks, just slightly less.",
    "Damn, you almost made something decent. Almost. Unfortunately, 'almost' still makes you a failure.",
    "It’s almost a star… if you squint… from a different continent… in the middle of a sandstorm.",
    "Damn, bro, it’s a star! Just a really, really shitty one.",
    "Hey! That almost looks like a star! If I tilt my head… and squint… and suffer a mild stroke.",
    "I see the effort. I don’t respect it, but I see it.",
    "This is almost acceptable. Which is to say, it’s still dogshit.",
    "I mean, you tried. And you failed slightly less than usual. That’s something, I guess.",
    "You're so close! Like getting to the toilet but still shitting yourself on the way.",
    "Your star is like your life—not quite there yet, but still a fucking joke.",
    "You’re almost there! Just a few more tries and you might actually make something worth looking at.",
    "This isn’t terrible, which is surprising coming from someone as fucking incompetent as you.",
    "If I gave a fucking paralyzed pigeon a crayon and let it have a seizure on paper, it’d look better than this.",
    "This looks like if someone described a star to a drunken baboon on meth."

    perfect: [
    //"perfect star"
    "You actually fucking did it! It… it looks like a star! (kinda) Go touch grass, moron, get out of the fucking basement.",
    "Oh damn! You finally drew a star! You know what? Fuck you anyway! You weren’t supposed to draw it perfectly!",
    "Holy shit, you made a decent star. Now go make some real life achievements, nerd.",
    "Damn thats pretty good! Congratulations, you wasted your time achieving this. Your parents must be so proud.",
    "Damn, you really put in the effort. Could’ve used that energy to fix your life, but hey, a star’s nice too.",
    "Oh, so you can follow basic geometry? Took you long enough, dumbass.",
    "This is peak human achievement. Too bad your social skills are still at rock bottom.",
    "Oh wow, you actually did it. Whoop-de-fucking-doo. Want a medal?",
    "Bro, how did you get so good at drawing stars? What deep trauma caused this skill? \nOh... i see... this one, but hey, you got a fancy new trauma to show off now <3",
    "What the fuck?! You actually drew a good star?! I take back everything I said. Just kidding, go fuck yourself."
