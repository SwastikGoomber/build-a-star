A stupid game I made because I thought it would be funny...
Aim: Draw a perfect star
- if you draw something that doesnt resemble a star -> it insults you
- if you draw a bad star -> it insults you
- if you draw a good star -> it insults you
- if you manage to draw a perfect star -> it appreciates you, and then insults you, obviously
